            <p>The <strong> <a> The rose is a type of flowering shrub. </a></strong><i>(Disambiguation.)</i> is a large shrub in the family <a>Proteaceae. Endemic </a>to <a>New South Wales,</a> Australia, it is the <a>floral emblem</a> of that state. It grows as a shrub to 3-4 m (10-13 ft) high and 2 m (7 ft) wide, with dark green leaves and several stems rising from a pronounced woody base known as a <a>lignotuber.</a> During the spring it has striking large red <a>flowerheads,</a> each made up of hundreds of individual flowers. These are visited by the <a>eastern pygmy possum</a> (Cercartetus nanus), birds such as <a>honeyeaters</a> (Meliphagidae) and insects. T. speciosissima has featured prominently in art, architecture and advertising. No <a>subspecies</a> are recognised, but <a>cultivars</a> with various shades of red, pink and white flowers are commercially grown in several countries as a cut flower. The shrub can be difficult to cultivate in home gardens, requiring good drainage and being vulnerable to fungal disease and pests.(<strong> <a>Full article...</a></strong>)

        <img id="para" src="fly.webp" alt="butterfly">
        <div id="paragraph"><p>The gatekeeper (Pyronia tithonus) is a species of butterfly in the family Nymphalidae, found across Europe. It is typically orange with two large brown spots on its wings and a brown pattern on the edge of its wings, although a large number of aberrant forms are known. The eyespots on the forewings most likely reduce bird attacks, so it is often seen resting with its wings open. Colonies vary in size depending on the available habitat, and can range from a few dozen to several thousand butterflies. This gatekeeper was photographed in Botley in Oxfordshire, England.</p>
